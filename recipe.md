Recipe - 
Prep: Preheat the oven to 425 F (220 C). Line a muffin tin with muffin liners or spray with nonstick spray.
Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Mix the Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, vanilla, and oil until well combined.
Combine Wet & Dry Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon or rubber spatula until just combined. This process will go quickly, and should only take about 10 stirs to complete. Fold in the chocolate chips at this point. Do not over-mix your batter or your muffins will be dense and dry.
Divide the batter between the muffin cups filling them almost all the way up. Top with more chocolate chips if desired.
Bake at 425 F for about 10 minutes and then turn the oven heat down to 350 F (175 C) for about 5 more minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs.
Your Delicious Choclate Muffin is Ready !!! Bon Appetite !!!
